<h4>Variable Speed Limit Signs</h4>
	<p>
		Variable speed limit signs display regulatory speed limits for current road conditions. Mountainous terrain and large elevation changes can result in rapidly varying conditions where drivers are required to adjust their speed to conditions. Variable speed limits change as road and weather conditions change. For example, speed limits may be reduced during snow events.

		However, even with a variable speed limit system, it is important that drivers drive to the conditions of the road, their vehicle, and their abilities.

		This map shows the location, regular maximum posted speed limit, current speed limit displayed, and when the speed limit was last changed for each variable speed limit sign.
