	The Vehicle Inspection Facilities map tool displays the location of facilities licensed to perform vehicle inspections 
	as determined by British Columbia’s Vehicle Inspections and Standards program. The tool can be used to browse and search 
	a map to find facilities in many towns and cities in BC, or to find facilities that are licenced to inspect specific 
	classes of vehicles. The tool also provides facility contact information and calculates travel distance and directions 
	from the user's current location to a chosen facility.
