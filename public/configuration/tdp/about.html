	<h4>Traffic Data Program</h4>
	<p>
		The Ministry of Transportation and Transit's Traffic Data Program monitors traffic at various locations 
		throughout British Columbia. Traffic data collection is a worldwide activity used to determine current traffic 
		patterns and help predict future traffic trends.
	</p>

	<p>
		Ministry staff uses the information to help support planning, design, construction, and operation of the ministry 
		road network. The findings can also be useful for a wide range of stakeholders, including consultants, developers, 
		other levels of government, and the general public.
