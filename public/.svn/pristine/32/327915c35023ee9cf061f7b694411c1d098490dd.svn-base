<center><h5 class="home-welcome">Welcome to the Traffic Data Program GIS Application</h5></center>

<p>
   The Traffic Data Program GIS Application allows you to find data associated with traffic count sites 
   along BC highways over multiple years. Once you have located a site along a highway of interest, you 
   can view the data associated with that site.

	The Ministry monitors traffic volumes in two ways: 
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Continuously at 120 permanent count stations.</li>
	<li>Over a 48-hour period every three years at 500+ short count stations.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Traffic data is published by Traffic Measurement Site (TMSite), a location where data from one or more 
	traffic count stations represents a cross section of roadway.
</p>

<p>
	<img class="home-icons-small" src="configuration/tdp/img/red_icon.png"> <b>Red Icon</b><br>
	Permanent count sites are identified by the character “P” in the site code (eg. P-16-1NS). Data collected 
	includes volumes for all sites, and speed and classification data for approximately 60 of these sites. Published data available include daily, monthly and annual reports.
</p>

<p>
	<img class="home-icons-small" src="configuration/tdp/img/green_icon.png"> <b>Green Icon</b><br> 
	Short count sites are identified by a five digit number with direction (eg. 11-036NS). Data collected 
	includes volumes for all sites, and speed and classification data for a few of these sites. Published data 
	available includes daily reports and an estimated Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT). 
</p>

<p>
	<img class="home-icons-big" src="configuration/tdp/img/blue_icon.png"> <b>1994 – 2003 Traffic Data:</b><br> 
	This layer provides summary Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) and Summer Average Daily Traffic (SADT) 
	statistics from permanent and short count stations. AADT represents the average number of vehicles passing 
	a point on the roadway in a day for a given year. SADT refers to traffic data collected in July and August only. 
</p>

<p>
	<img class="home-icons-big" src="configuration/tdp/img/orange_icon.png"> <b>Turning Movement Counts:</b><br> 
	This layer shows turning movement counts and traffic data collected with signal controllers at various 
	intersections around BC. Many of these reports identify turning and through-traffic volumes during peak 
	hours of the day.
</p>

<p>
	<img class="home-icons-big" src="configuration/tdp/img/road_icon.png"> <b>Uniform Traffic Volume Segments (UTVS):</b><br> 
	The coloured lines represent segments of the provincial highway network within which the traffic volume is 
	deemed to be consistent. Each UTVS is represented by a traffic measurement site, which determines a cross 
	section of the roadway to provide the Average Annual Daily Traffic statistic.
