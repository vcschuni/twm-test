		The Commercial Vehicle Routing Tool uses the DataBC Route Planner to generate the shortest route between two points. It will display 
		conflicts for structures on that route which have any known restriction less than the weight, height, width and/or length entered.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The route generated can be manually altered to avoid conflicting structures as well as any other hazards on the route.
	</p>
	
	It does not:
	<ul>
		<li>look for the best route for your vehicle's dimensions or weight</li>
		<li>reflect local truck bylaws</li>
		<li>reflect pre-approved corridors for commercial vehicles</li>
		<li>imply any provincial or municipal permit approval</li>
		<li>reflect travel times for commercial vehicles (times displayed are estimates from the DataBC Route Planner)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Clearance information is correct and current to the best of our knowledge, but we do not guarantee accuracy. In some cases, 
		the turn by turn instructions along the left side of the map may show the restrictions on the requested route in an incorrect 
		order. If that occurs, zoom into the map to the level where each restriction appears in its own yellow shield, for the most 
		accurate location information. If you notice a discrepancy, please send the structure name and location, and a description of 
		the error to onRouteBC@gov.bc.ca.
